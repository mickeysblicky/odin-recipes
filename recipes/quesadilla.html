        <h1> <strong> Description</strong></h1>
        <p> A quesadilla is a heated tortilla wiwth meleted cheese inside. But in
            addition to cheese, you can put practically anything in a quesadilla.
             Traditional quesadillas were made with a corn tortilla that was warmed
              on a griddle, filled with cheese and various other fillings (meat,
               vegetables), and then folded over to be eaten by hand.
        </p>
         <h1> <strong> Ingredients</strong></h1>
         <ul>
             <Li> <strong> Large flour tortillas</strong></Li>
             <Li> <strong> Grated cheese</strong> - either mild, sharp cheddar, or Monterey Jack</Li>
             <Li> <strong> Olive oil or butter</strong></Li>
                 
         </ul>

         <h1> <strong> Steps</strong></h1>
         <ol>
             <Li> <strong> Heat the tortillas until air pockets form.</strong> Heat a large skillet
             (cast iron works great) on medium high heat. Add a small amount of oil (about 1/2
             teaspoon) and spread it around the bottom of the pan with a spatula (you could use 
            butter as well). 
            <p> Take one large flour tortilla and place it in the pan. Flip the 
                tortilla over a few times, 10 seconds between flips. Air pockets should begin to 
                form within the tortilla.</p></Li>
            
                <Li> <strong> Add cheese and other ingredients.</strong> When pockets of air
                 begin to form, take a handful of grated cheese, sprinkle over the top of the
                 tortilla, making sure that the cheese does not land on the pan itself.
                <p> Add whatever additional ingredients you choose - green onion, sliced
                     mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc. If you would like your quesadilla to be
                      a chicken quesadilla, add some diced cooked chicken.
                </p>
            <p> Take care not to layer on the ingredients too thickly - this is a quesadilla, not
                 a quiche!</p></Li>

            <Li> <strong> Lower heat and cover pan.</strong> Reduce the heat to low and cover the
             pan. The pan should be hot enough by now to have plenty of residual heat to melt the
             cheese and brown tortilla. If the quesadilla begins to smoke too much, remove from 
            the heat.
        <p> After a minute, check to see if the cheese is melted. If not, return the cover and
             keep checking every minute until the cheese is melted.</p></Li>

            <Li> <strong> Fold tortilla over.</strong> When the cheese is sufficiently melted,
             use a spatula to lift up one side of the quesadilla and flip over the other side, as
             if you were making an omelette.
            <p> The tortilla should by now be browned slightly. If it is not browned, turn the heat
                 up to high and flip the quesadilla over every 10 seconds or so until it gets
                  browned.</p></Li>

            <Li> <strong> Remove quesadilla from pan and cut into wedges.</strong> To make the
             lettuce to accompany the quesadilla, thinly slice some iceberg lettuce. Sprinkle smoke
            cider vinegar on it and some salt.
        <p> Serve with the lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.</p></Li>
         </ol>
