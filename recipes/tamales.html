    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Tamales are a traditional Mexican dish made with a corn based dough mixture that is filled with various meats or
        beans and cheese. Tamales are wrapped and cooked in corn husks or banana leaves, but they are removed from the
        husks before eating. Try them served with pico de gallo on top and a side of guacamole and rice.
    </p>


    <p>While making tamales is a process (made very fun with multiple people to help stuff and wrap them!), it’s really
        simple, so don’t be intimidated! There are just two main elements; the dough, and the filling.
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul><strong> The dough,</strong> called "masa" is spread on the corn husk. The corn husks do not get eaten,theey are
        just used to envelope the dough and filling of the tamale which gets cooked inside.</ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul><strong>The filling.</strong> You can fill the tamales with meat or beans and cheese.</ul>

    <h1> <strong>Ingredients</strong> </h1>
    <ul>
        <Li> <strong> Masa harina</strong> </Li>
        <Li> <strong> Broth</strong> </Li>
        <Li> <strong> Baking Powder </strong> </Li>
        <Li> <strong> Salt </strong> </Li>
        <Li> <strong> Cumin </strong> </Li>
        <Li> <strong> Lard</strong> </Li>
        <Li> <strong> Dried corn husks</strong> </Li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h1> <strong> Steps</strong> </h1>
    <ol> 
       <Li> <strong> Soak the corn husks.</strong> Place corn husks in a bowl of very
    hot water for 30 minutes or until softened.</Li>
     <Li><strong> Prepare desired filling.</strong> You'll need about 3 1/2-4 cups of filling
    for one batch of tamale dough.</Li>
     <Li><strong> Make the masa dough.</strong> In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat 
    the lard and 2 tablespoons of broth until fluffy,about 3-5 minutes. Combine the masa flour,
    baking powder,salt, and cumin in a medium bowl; stir into the lard mixture and beat well with 
    an electric mixer. Add the broth, little by little to form a very soft dough. Beat on high speed 
    for several minutes. The dough should spread like creamy peanut butter and be slightly sticky. 
    Cover the mixing bowl with a damp paper towel, to keep the dough from drying out.</Li>
    
     <Li><strong> Assemble the tamales.</strong> Lay a corn husk, glossy side up, on the counter
     with the wide end at the top. Scoot about 1/4 cup of dough onto the top, center of the corn 
    husk. Lay a piece of plastic wrap over the dough and use your hands to press and spread the masa 
    into a thin layer, about 1/4 inch thick. Keep the dough spread along the <em>top half</em> of the 
    corn husk to allow plenty of room to fold the bottom husk up, when it's time. 
    <p> Place 1-2 tablespoons of desired filling in a line down the center of the dough. (You don't want
        too much filling).
    </p>
    <p> Fold-in one long side of the husk over the filling. Fold in the other long side, overlapping the
         the first (like folding a brochure). Fold the bottom of the husk up.<em><strong> Optional:</strong></em>
          Tear a long strip from an edge of one of the soaked corn husks and use it to tie the tamale, to hold it together.
    </p></Li>

     <Li><strong> Tie the tamales (optional).</strong> Tying the tamales can help you differentiate them if making more than
    one filling. However, you don't <em>have</em> to tie a corn husk string around them to secure them, as they will hold
    together without it, stacked upright, side-by-side in the pot.</Li>

     <Li><strong> Cook on the stove-top or instand pot.</strong> Add water to the bottom of your stove-top steamer or Instant
     Pot pressure cooker. (About 1 cup for IP and a few cups for a steamer pot--don't fill above the steamer rack.) Lay a few
     extra corn husks on the bottom rack to keep the tamales from falling through and any boiling water from directly touching them.
    <p> Place tamales standing upright, with the open end up, just tightly enough to keep them standing. If using a streamer, lay a
         few soaked corn husks or a wet towel over the top of the tamales before closing the lid.
    </p>
    <p> <strong> Steamer.</strong> Bring water to a boil and once boiling, reduce to a simmer and steam for 1 to 2 hours (or even
     longer, depending on how many you're making). Check them after 1 hour. (In Mexico they would often place a coin at the bottom
     of the steamer and when the coin started to tap in the pot you know the water was low and you need to add more.)
    </p>
    <p> <strong> Instant Pot.</strong> Cook on Manual/High Pressure for 25 minutes. Allow pressure to naturally release for 10 minutes,
     and then quick release. </p></Li>
     </ol>
